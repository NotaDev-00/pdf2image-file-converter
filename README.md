# pdf2image-file-converter
Converts PDF file into an Image file.

Before you may use this program, first, you must download the poppler file. You can look it up on the other website, or copy this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LBtTiJj2xRlgBMV-mTf_E64cDCpmgINl/view?usp=sharing to download. After you download it, make sure to extract it.

This is a python program that I recreated from some of the Youtube videos that I’ve watched. This is a simple program that allows you to convert your PDF file to an Image file. One of the changes I put to this program is that you can manually input the “path” of the pdf File and the “path” of the folder you wanted to save your image file on the terminal rather than putting it all at the code itself.

Please see the comment lines inside the code to check some of the changes you needed to do.

When you run the program, you can see the warning message, then asking you to enter the path of your PDF file.

The step for finding the path of your pdf file is, to right-click your pdf file, then press properties, go to the security tab then copy the object name shown below.

After you enter the path of the pdf file, press enter.

Then if there was no error, the program will ask you to enter the folder in which you wanted to save the converted pdf–image file.

Copy the path of the folder.

Press enter.

At this point, the program will stop, if there is no shown error, that means the conversion is now completed.
